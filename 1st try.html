	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<img src="" class="Me">
	<p>I'm a native to Colorado but have lived in Washington state and Wisconsin. I was recently married to the love of life Kristen. We met many years ago while working together at Red Lobster. We are going to honeymoon in Euorpe next fall. We want to see the Louvre in Paris, taste wine in Italy, and visit the castles of Germany.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Until then I am excited to be a part of this coding boot camp. The oppurtunties that await are endless. I hope to be able to take my new found skills and make this world a little better.</p>
